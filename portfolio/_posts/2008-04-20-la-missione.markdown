From 2003–2005 I served an LDS mission in Rome and every week I wrote e-mails to my family and friends detailing my experiences in Italy. I've been working on compiling all theses e-mails I wrote over those two years into a gorgeous full color book. I've only had time to finish one chapter so far, but I'm pretty happy with how it's turning out.

I used several Perl scripts and Word macros to wrangle all the text into a standard and useable format, which has saved countless hours of work—there were hundreds of e-mails!

Some day I'll get around to finally finishing it. In the meantime, you can [download the one finished (and beautiful) chapter.](http://files.andrewheiss.com/portfolio/La%20missione%20sample.pdf)
