- Ongoing series of minimalist photo books
---

Since we got married in 2005, Nancy and I have taken tens of thousands of pictures (spending so much time in the Middle East has probably been a major reason for this :)). Sadly, those pictures sit and gather virtual dust on several hard drives, so in an effort to do something useful with them, we created the *One Thousand Words* series of photo books. 

The books are available at Lulu:
