This site was commissioned for a series of summer folk music camps held in Idaho and Utah by a new startup called [Blue Sky Music Camps](http://www.blueskymusiccamps.com/ "Blue Sky Music Camps"), founded by members of the Aaron Ashton Band and Ryan Shupe and the Rubber Band, local Utah County music groups. I was given the basic design and was responsible for the rest: HTML/CSS coding, backend scripting for camp registration and payment, and managing a marketing e-mail subscription list.
