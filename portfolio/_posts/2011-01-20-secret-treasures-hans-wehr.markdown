A friend of mine started a Facebook group back in 2007 in an effort to collect and compile all the fantastically strange entries in the venerable [Hans Wehr Arabic&ndash;English dictionary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_of_Modern_Written_Arabic). The group became fairly large, but because of the ephemeral nature of Facebook it was impossible to keep a good archive of words or track conversations about the entires. To make these dictionary entires more accessible, we created a central database to house and organize all the words we (and others) had found. 

The site runs on Drupal&mdash;my first foray into this crazy powerful CMS. I would have been utterly lost without the help of [@shadysamir](http://twitter.com/#!/shadysamir), the Egyptian Drupal expert.
